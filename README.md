# Student-Management-System 

The **Student Management System** is a C-based program designed to efficiently manage student information. It provides a user-friendly interface to perform various operations such as adding, displaying, searching, updating, and analyzing student data. This project demonstrates the use of fundamental programming concepts like conditions, loops, strings, structs, pointers, and data structures (linked lists).

## Features

- **Add New Students**: Easily add new students to the system with details like name, ID, age, and GPA.
- **Display All Students**: View a list of all students stored in the system.
- **Search for a Student**: Find a specific student by their unique ID.
- **Update Student Details**: Modify the information of an existing student.
- **Calculate Average GPA**: Compute the average GPA of all students in the system.
- **Find the Highest GPA**: Identify the student with the highest GPA.
- **Efficient Data Management**: Utilizes linked lists for dynamic memory allocation and efficient data handling.

## How It Works

The program is built using core C programming concepts:
- **Structs**: To define a student data type containing fields like name, ID, age, and GPA.
- **Linked Lists**: To dynamically store and manage student records.
- **Pointers**: For efficient memory management and traversal of the linked list.
- **Loops and Conditions**: To implement the program's logic and user interaction.
